# markdown.doctools

[Doctools](http://tcllib.sourceforge.net/doc/doctools.html) is a Tcl Standard Library package that provides a Tcl-command-based markup language for writing documentation. It is ostensibly extensible by writing new output modules to support conversion to new documentation formats. This repository contains a partial implementation of a doctools output module for [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). I have abandoned this project and hereby release it to the public domain.
